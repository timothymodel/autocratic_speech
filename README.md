Political analysts and media outlets like the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-scholar-of-fascism-sees-a-lot-thats-familiar-with-trump), [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-authoritarian-mueller-813585/), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettedkins/2016/07/22/media-confounded-by-donald-trumps-authoritarian-speech/#1eff64d567dd), and [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/17/trump-rhetoric-techniques/97463770/) describe Donald Trump’s language as resembling that of an autocrat. These writers worry that the language of authoritarianism could push American political institutions into mirroring those in authoritarian countries – unaccountable, unresponsive, unrepresentative, and corrupt. 

Does Trump, indeed, sound like an autocrat? The included analysis compares Trump's State of the Union (SOTU) speeches to Vladimir Putin's annual Addresses to the Federal Assembly, Russia's SOTU equivalent.
